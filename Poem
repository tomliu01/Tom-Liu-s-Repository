There is a place,
Along the middle east,
Where the tallest building,
And the biggest shopping mall exist.
 
Far away from the city,
The sparkling sands shows up.
The warm wind blows through,
With absolute no feelings of aloof.
 
Nights and days,
The heart of the city is always alive.
With a comfortable car ride on a Lamborghini,
You will feel the sense of Dubai.
